# cache-in-spring-boot
I have created this project to learn basic caching in spring boot.

# Self notes for the project

	1. This Spring Boot Application exposes simple REST APIs for getting list of all users and 
	 to update information about a particular user.
	2. It uses Lombok for getters,setters and constructors etc.
	3. It uses caching provided in Spring framework.
	4. When data related to a particular user is updated, I have used CachePut to update the cache.
